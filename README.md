Online Attendance Monitoring System (Deploying Facial Recognition)

This deploys a facial recognition algorithm to match the student's face to the pre-stored images (taken during the student's application registration). The application then provides a consolidated data of student's attendance to the concerned faculty in charge.

The below mentioned link describes the working of the project.
